0.- Before initialize the module you should make sure the __Parser.php__ file is into the directory __vendor/makechtec/nanokit/Url__ 
from the base project directory, if it's not you need to modify the constant value.

    public const FROM_ROOT_DIRECTORY_PROJECT = 'vendor/makechtec/nanokit/Url';

For your right directory

    public const FROM_ROOT_DIRECTORY_PROJECT = 'another_directories/Url';

IMPORTANT: The most part of modules depend of this file.

This module is used for url tratements like make an array from slugs, remove slugs, etc.
